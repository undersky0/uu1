# A relation defines a type of {Tie} between two {Actor Actors}. From social literature, 
# {Relation Relations} can be affective (friendship, liking, respect), formal or biological
# (authority, kinship), transfer of material resources (transactions, lending and borrowing),
# messages or conversations, physical connection and affiliation to same organizations.
#
# = Relation types defined in {SocialStream Social Stream}
#
# All the above cases could be supported in {SocialStream Social Stream}.
# Nevertheless, the following {Relation Relations} are defined. All of them inherit from the
# {Relation} class:
#
# {Relation::Custom}:: user-defined {Relation}. Every {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subject}
#                      is able to define their own {Relation::Custom Custom relation},
#                      giving them a custom name 
#                      (for instance: friend, colleague, partner, buddy) and {Permission Permissions}.
# {Relation::Public}:: default {Relation} for ocassional {Tie Ties}.
# {Relation::Reject}:: the {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subject} does not want to add the other
#                      as a contact. A new {Tie} is created using this {Relation}
#
# You can define new {Relation Relations} in your application. Just create a new class and
# inherit from {Relation}. This class already supports
# {http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#label-Single+table+inheritance Single Table Inheritance (STI)}.
#
# = Relations and link building
#
# When a {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subject} creates a new link to other
# {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subject}, she must specify one or serveral {Relation Relations}
# for that link. (friend, colleague, {Relation::Public} or {Relation::Reject}.
# A new {Tie} will be created for each {Relation}
#
# = Permissions
#
# {SocialStream::Models::Subject Subjects} assign {Permission permissions} to {Relation Relations}.
# This way, when establishing {Tie ties}, they are granting permissions to their contacts.
#
# See the documentation of {Permission} for more details on permission definition.
#
# = {Activity Activities} and {Relation Relations}
#
# Each {Activity} can be attached to one or more {Relation relations}.
# It sets the {Audience} that has access to it, and the {Permission Permissions} that rule that access.
